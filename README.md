# Plant-Disease-Identifier
Powdery mildew is a disease that can be catastrophic to plants and their surrounding ecosystems.
Identifying the disease is the first step toward fighting it. To do this, we trained a variety of
convolutional neural networks to perform image recognition and classification. We trained our
models using the seminal LeNet Architecture. We tested the impact that increasing the size of the
training dataset had on the accuracy of the predictions. We also tested how training models using
datasets with different types of images impacts prediction accuracy. We were able to
successfully train a neural network that identifies the presence of powdery mildew with 100%
accuracy and the absence of powdery mildew with 90% accuracy when tested with new images.
